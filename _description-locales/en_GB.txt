Zipline Uploads allow you to upload your right clicked files or shorten your right clicked URLs to your selfhosted instance of Zipline (https://github.com/diced/zipline) without having to download the file to your PC and upload it manually.

Adds a "Upload File to Zipline" option in the context menu when right clicking an image, a video or an audio file.
Adds a "Upload Text to Zipline" option in the context menu when right clicking a selected text.
Adds a "Shorten URL with zipline" option in the context menu when right clicking a link.
[Experimental] Adds a "Upload URL to Zipline" option in the context menu when right clicking a link, it allows to upload the content of the URL (this feature is disabled by default but can be enabled in the settings by enabling the "Enable Experimental Features" toggle).
All of the right context menu options have a "Advanced Options" variant which allows you to:
- on shorten, add a vanity name and a password to the link (password is V4 only).
- on uploads, set configs such as password, max views, compression, folder, filename etc. just for that specific file (folder and filename are V4 only).

For it to work you first have to open the extension's popup and set your Zipline URL and Zipline token.

All the settings are saved automatically in the local storage of your browser.
